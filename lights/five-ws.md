# Who does what we do?
On a weekly basis, there is one lighting board operator who takes command of the whole system at each campus
# What do we do?
On the lighting team, we used appropriate conventional, LED, and moving lighting to enchance the different atmospheres of our services.
# Where do we do what we do?
In both of our sanctuaries, we have a tech booth where our lighting board operators do their thing. At CTG it is located in the balcony. At CTB, it's in the back of the room.
# When do we do what we do?
Currently, there's a rotation of 3 ops at CTG.
At the moment, there are trainees at CTB vying to claim the top spot as CTB LBO. You could be #1!
# Why do we do what we do?
As lighting board operators, our goal is to create an atmosphere that encourages the congregation to enter the presence of God. We are grateful that, through His sovereignty, He chose us to help lead His people into worship. We aim to use lights to share the same encounter that we ourselves have experienced in our services with others.
> For instance, if our worship teammates are on stage singing a slow, moving song, then we understand that it is not the appropriate time to strobe lights. 

Yes that's a radical example, but explicitly defined nonetheless. Here is something a little more subtle:
> At the end of the worship portion of our service, someone comes up on stage, greets our congregation, and allows them to greet eachother. While greeting someone, it's pretty clear that you'd like to see their face. In this instance we have to raise lights from a "worship" level to a "greeting" level in order to accomodate this moment. While it may be *possible* to see somebody when lights are dim, it may not be *easy*.
