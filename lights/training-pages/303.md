<!-- TITLE: 303 - Sample weekend flow -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Here we'll go through the entire weekend process from confirm on PCO to Shutdown -->

# PCO Confirm
After we've confirmed on PCO, we'll have access to the service. It's recommended is that we listen to the songs at least once before attending the rehearsal. It prepares us for new songs and subtly allows us to begin to determine how we are going to use the lights to enhance the atmosphere that the song will create. When we login and view the service we'll see this:
**INSERT PCO SERVICE GRAPHIC**
At the of the window top right, we'll click REHEARSE (make sure this is right)
**INSERT MEDIA PLAYER IMAGE**
_Note: this workflow may be slightly different on the app, but terms should still be the same_

These are the songs that we'll have for our sample service:
