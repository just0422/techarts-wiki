# Key Terms
| Term | Defintion |
| --- | --- |
| Pan | Rotation on the horizontal plane |
| Tilt | Rotaion on the vertical plane |
| Gobo | Imaging placing a stencil in front of a light and viewing the image on the other side |
| Iris | Similar to the iris of an eye. Controls how much light escapes the fixture |
| Focus | When a light is focused, the edge of the beam on the surface it is projected onto is sharpened |
| Frost | This can be thought of as "fuzzing" the beam |
| Lamp | What is commonly known as a "bulb." It is _the_ source of light for the fixture |

## Color Mixing Theory Intro
This is one of the foundational concepts in lighting. Many intelligent fixtures are capable of color mixing. What does that mean? Well in lighting, there are 3 primary colors: <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">Red</span>, <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">Green</span>, <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">Blue</span>. These colors can be mixed togethert different ratios to create over 16,000,000 colors. Take a look at these examples:
**MAKE RED RGB**
**MAKE GREEN RGB**
**MAKE BLUE RGB**
**MAKE MAGENTA RGB**
**MAKE AMBER RGB**
**MAKE WHITE RGB**
**MAKE BLACK RGB**

<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">Red</span>, <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">Green</span>, <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">Blue</span> can be mixed to make up most colors imaginable. However, <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">R</span><span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">G</span><span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">B</span> is not the only color mixing stragety. It is an additive color mixing strategy. There is, in fact, a subtractive color mixing strategy that is based off of the secondary colors <span style="color:cyan; font-weight:bold">Cyan</span>, <span style="color:magenta; font-weight:bold">Magenta</span>, and <span style="color:#e6e600; font-weight:bold">Yellow</span>. <span style="color:cyan; font-weight:bold">C</span><span style="color:magenta; font-weight:bold">M</span><span style="color:#e6e600; font-weight:bold">Y</span> works the same as <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">R</span><span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">G</span><span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">B</span>, however it's values tend to be the opposite. Look at these examples below:
**MAKE RED CMY**
**MAKE GREEN CMY**
**MAKE BLUE CMY**
**MAKE MAGENTA CMY**
**MAKE AMBER CMY**
**MAKE WHITE CMY**
**MAKE BLACK CMY**

Both color mixing strategies can be used in our console. It is up to the board operator to decide what they like best.

# GrandMA Operation
## The smart screen
Before we get to play with the actual lights, we need to understand one particular screen that allows us to utilize the full capability of each fixture. It's called the smart screen and it looks like this:
**INSERT SMART IMAGE HERE**

If this screen is not visible on any of the three screens, then move over to the rightmost touchscreen and tap the top button as shown below:
**INSERT SMART IMAGE BUTTON PRESS HERE**

When you select channel one:
**CHANNEL 1 AT 100**
This will pop up:
**INSERT CHANNEL 1 SMART SCREEN**

As you can see, this conventional light's dimmer attribute pops up. If we tap it, it becomes adustable with the wheel directly below:
**INSERT ENCODER WHEEL ADJUSTING DIMMER**

As you'll see below, this is the page where we can truly dig in and play with some lights.

## LED Tape
This is our LED Tape. It's pretty easy to find if you look at the stage:
**INSERT LED TAPE IMAGE**

Now let's go select it:
**CHANNELS 301 THRU 330 AT FULL**

Let's look at what pops up on the smart screen
**INSERT SMART SCREEN LED TAPE**

There are now two fields in the smart screen. The same dimmer as existed before is there, but there's a new one ColorMix. This is what you may see:
**INSERT COLORMIX BOTTOM BAR**
If you don't, then tap color mix, and you'll see this:
**INSERT COLORPICKER BOTTOM BAR**
If, you see _HSB_, just tap it and RGB or CMY whould show up
