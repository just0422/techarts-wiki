<!-- TITLE: 301 - Cues and Lists and everything else -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: After completing this tutorial, you should have everything you need to be able to "do lights" -->

# Key Terms
| Term | Defintion |
| --- | --- |
| Cue | a recorded "scene" in side the lighting console |
| Cuelist | as the name states, a list of cues (even if it is only one cue) |
| Fader | On the console, there are levers that can be slid up and down. Cuelists (and other things ;) ) can be assigned to them |
| Button | Not to be confused with the generic "button," this corresponds with a cuelist that has been assigned to any of the buttons to the right of the faders |
| Exectuor | Related to faders/buttons, but not quite. While faders/buttons are physical levers/buttons, executors are what you see on screen. Executors can change, faders cannot) |
| Page | There can be multiple pages of faders and buttons where the same physical fader/button assumes different roles depending on the page number |

# Cues
At this point, we've learned to play with all of our fixtures and utilize the features that make them unique. It would be very cumbersome, however, to attempt to do this during service. We'd have to press a lot of buttons in a very small amount of time. As we've seen with lighting board ops already, it looks like they press a bunch of buttons, but it really isnt _that_ many. How is this so? Through the magic of cues. Cues allow us to record any paramater of any light we adjust. That's all we need to know about creating them though. Let's learn how to use them. At the bottom of each screen, you'll see this:
**INSERT IMAGES OF FADERS** or **INSERT IMAGE OF BUTTONS**
If you don't see either of these, press one of these buttons to make them appear:
** EXECUTOR FADER/BUTTON +/-**

Each of those are exectors. We are going to focus on the yellow ones.
