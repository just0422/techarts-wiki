<!-- TITLE: Terms and Defintions -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: The following theory are the building blocks for lighting at CT -->

Before you actually begin to touch the board, it's necessary to learn some terms and theories that we use as we communicate.
| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Fixture | Every physical light we have is referred to as a fixture |
| Intensity | The strength of a light's output, usually denoted as a percentage |

# Fixture types
To start off, we split lights up into three main categories: [Conventional Fixtures](#conventional-fixtures), [LED Fixtures](#led-fixtures), [Moving Fixtures](#moving-fixtures)

| Fixture type | Usage | Application |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Conventional Fixtures | A conventional fixture is one that has one basic operation: Intensity. It can only turn on and off. We set them at whatever percentage we like and change them when necessary. That's all  | At CTG, our entire front light system is made up of conventional fixtures |


## Conventional Fixtures
A conventional fixture is one that has one basic operation: Intensity. It can only turn on and off. We set them at whatever percentage we like and change them when necessary. That's all.

At CTG, our entire front light system is made up of conventional fixtures.

## LED Fixtures
Any light that is *not* conventional is considered intelligent. All of the LEDs we have are intelligent lights. What does this mean? LEDs have the capability of having their intensity adjusted, but it doesn't stop there. All of our LEDs can change color as well. Some of them can strobe and utilize special built in functions (like sound sensitivity)

We have a wide range of LEDs at all of our campuses. They are a powerful tool in establishing the atmosphere through color, intensity and sometimes other effects)

## Moving Fixtures
These are easily the most recognizable type of intelligent light. Any light that can move without the physical intervention of a person is considered a moving light. Moving is the only possiblity though. We have full control over intensity, color and strobe just like all the previous lights. In addition, we can also control gobos, iris, focus, and other functions. We'll get into those later, no need to define them now.

We have moving fixtures at all of our campuses. Each type is unique in the features that we can use and what it looks like when its intensity is at 100%.

# Beam types
