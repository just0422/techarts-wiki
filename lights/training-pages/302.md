# Back to the feels
We've spent a lot of time on this journey learning about the lighting console. While it is a fantastic piece of hardware, it is only a tool that we use to accomplish the greater goal. For that reason, now that we're comfortable with the lighting console and terminology, we're going to learn about what it takes to make a service feel appropriate. So let's take a step back to [101](lights/training-pages/101) and let's spend the rest of this article visualizing some examples of what we'd like each of the elements of our service to look like.

## Walk-in
This elment takes place before service. There is a look already programmed into the board, but if we had to create our own look, we could keep house lights up, front light down, bring the optis up in <span style="color: cyan; font-weight:bold">Cyan</span>, bring up the LED tape in <span style="background-color: grey; color: white; font-weight: bold"> White </span> and a gobo in the infiniti's tilted into the house just low enough where they won't hit anyone's eyes.
