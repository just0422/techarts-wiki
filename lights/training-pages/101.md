<!-- TITLE: 101 - Feeling out a room -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Here is step 1 on the journey through lights -->

# What does this mean?
As per the standards doc, "feeling out a room" is fundamentally necessary for becoming a lighting board operator on our team. 

So what does this phrase mean? Well, every service we put on is full of moments. Any one of these moments call for a unique atmosphere in the room. When you walk into service during the middle of worship, it feels completely different than when you would walk in during annoucements, or a sermon. We use the lighting equipment we have to facilitate these feelings and enhance the atmosphere in the room.

# How is this done?
Before this question gets answered, let's establish a few terms that will be used throughout the rest of your lighting career
