<!-- TITLE: 101 - Feeling out a room -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Here is step 1 on the journey through lights -->

# What does this mean?
As per the standards doc, "feeling out a room" is fundamentally necessary for becoming a lighting board operator on our team. 

So what does this phrase mean? Well, every service we put on is full of moments. Any one of these moments call for a unique atmosphere in the room. When you walk into service during the middle of worship, it feels completely different than when you would walk in during annoucements, or a sermon. We use the lighting equipment we have to facilitate these feelings and enhance the atmosphere in the room.

# How is this done?
Before this question gets answered, let's establish a few terms that will be used throughout the rest of your TechArts career

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Stage | The platform from where singers/preachers stand |
| House | The area of the room where the congregation sits |
| Front Light | Imaging standing on stage looking at the congregation. All of the light that is hitting your face is front light |
| House Lignt | If you are sitting in the house, the lights above your head that allow you to read are considered house lights |

-----

Front light and house light are the two most pivotal areas of lighting we have at CT. Think about it. Without them, services are much more difficult to facilitate. With them, we can generate the foundation of creating an atmosphere in the room. To illustrate what was just stated, take a look at these examples below.
> Let's say we shut off front light. We _may_ be able to see the vague shadows and outlines of people on stage. When we turn those lights back on, it's pretty easy to understand that we can see them. However, with front light on, we can now see the faces and interpret the emotions of those who are on stage. Seeing those things allow members of the congretation to connect with those on stagee. This makes it that much easier to fall into the worship moment

> What would happen if the house lights are at their brightest during the most intimate moments of a service? It would probably be pretty awkward. Church service worship segments are a communal way of connecting to God through music. However, albeit communal, most people desire to engage in individual interactions with Him. In order to help that process along, we keep house lights low during worship.
> 
> Another example lies in the sermon. If the house lights are off, we run the possibility of preventing somebody from seeing their bible or notebook. Some people need the physical pen and paper to get the most out of the message they're hearing. We try and facilitate that while keeping the main focus on stage. This is why the stage will seem brighter.

Let's walk through the flow of one of our services and get an idea of what front light and house lights are at:
| Front Light | House Lights | Segment | Description
| ------------ | --------------- | --- | --- |
| _Off_ | Bright | Walk-in | This segment happens before service starts. We keep the stage off because there's no reason to draw any attention to it. Nobody is on stage. However, we keep house lights bright to make sure that people walking in can see each other and have an opportunity to converse and fellowship before service |
| _Off_ | Less Bright | Countdown | When the countdown goes up, there is still no one on stage, so we keep front light off. House lights, on the other hand, transition usually drop a little bit (~10%). This slight drop begins to subtly to set the atmosphere of worship as the countdown rolls |
| Bright | Low | Worship | We keep front light up during worship so that we can see the singers on stage. House lights get lowered, though, so that people in the house can not only engage with the singers, but privately engage with our God |
| Bright | Bright | Greeting & Announcements | During greeting and annoucements, we bring the house lights back up so that people can see each other and their seats as they great and get ready to hear annoucements |
| _Off_ | Almost _off_ | Video | _If_ there is a video during annoucements, we turn off stage lights and lower house lights so that all focus may be directed towards the screens |
| _Depends_ | Low | Special | This part of service is dedicated to a special creative element. Here we can take a more liberal approach to front light and determine what it should be based off of the creative piece. House lights, however, we keep low so that we can keep focus towards the stage |
| Bright-ish | Medium | Sermon | During the sermon, we keep the houselights roughtly halfway between bright and dark so that people can see what they are reading, but the focus stays on the speaker. Frontlight is always on and always bright. However there's a small caveat, but we can get into that in later lessons |


_If you've reached, you are one step closer to being a light board operator. In most tutorials, you'd expect the a link to the next tutorial. I'm going to refrain from that, simply because the next step I want you to take is to shadow any one of our guys for one service and keep everything you've read in mind_
