Before you get into any of the following steps, I'd like to make you aware that there is a lot of shadowing involved in this process.

With that said, before you start read, you should *shadow* one of our lighting board operators once
* [101 - Feeling Out a Room](/lights/training-pages/101)

Before you read on, I suggest you arrange a service of _shadowing_
* [201 - Terms and Definitions](/lights/training-pages/201)
* [202 - GrandMA is your friend (Part 1)](/lights/training-pages/202)
* 203 - GrandMA is your Friend (Part 2)
   * [203 CTG](/lights/training-pages/203g) 
   * [203 CTB](/lights/training-pages/203b)

When you reach here, sit down and play with the lighting board to practice what you've learned
*Then* do some *shadowing*
