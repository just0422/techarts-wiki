Before you get into any of the following steps, I'd like to make you aware that there is a lot of _shadowing_ involved in this process.

# The basics
With that said, before you start read, you should *shadow* one of our lighting board operators once. Contact Justin, and he'll get you going.

Before you read on, I suggest you arrange a service of _shadowing_
* [201 - Terms and Definitions](/lights/training-pages/201)
* [202 - GrandMA is your friend (Part 1)](/lights/training-pages/202)
* 203 - GrandMA is your Friend (Part 2)
   * [203 CTG](/lights/training-pages/203g) 
   * [203 CTB](/lights/training-pages/203b)

When you reach here, sit down and play with the lighting board to practice what you've learned
*Then* do some *shadowing*

* [301 - Cues and Lists and everything else](/lights/training-pages/301)
* [302 - Music 101](/lights/training-pages/302)
* [303 - How do we "do lights"?](/lights/training-pages/303)
* [304 - Sample Weekend flow](/lights/training-pages/304)

At this point, you should probably get some real practice behind the board. However, _first_, some _shadowing_.
Then we can sit down and together and simulate services. Once we're comfortable that you'll succeed, you'll be ready for your first service.

Advice: you should reach this part only when you are _absolutely_ comfortable with everything in the previous articles. What goes on after here is _not_ necessary to run a Sunday service, however, it really allows you to take command of the GrandMA lighting console
