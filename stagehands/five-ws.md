# Who does what we do?
The Stage crew is a team split up by stage managers and stage hands. They are the team members in charge of everything and anything that goes on with the stage. For most services there are at least 3 team members: 1 stage manager and 2 stagehands.
# What do we do?
As a stage manager, our job is to oversee and direct all of our stage hands and be the buffer of communication with the pastors and the technical producers during service.
Our jobs as stagehands are to make sure the podium, water table and microphones go on stage at precise times during the service. Wee movem also handle thent of any other props that need to be placed on stage for special services. 
# Where do we do what we do?
We usually sit in the front of the sanctuary unless personnel need to be set up elsewhere in the room during special moments in a service.  Our stage manager will be the person closest to the pastor, to communicate any in-service changes.  
# When do we do what we do?
At CTG, our stage managers serve 1-2 times per month on Sundays and 2 times a month on Wednesdays.  Our stagehands serve 1-2 times per month as well. 
At CTBE, we are in the process of building our stage management team.  Our stagehands serve 1-2 times per month. 
At CTBPM, we too are builing up our stage crew team. we currently have a technical producer that is resposible to the stage management duties. 
# Why do we do what we do?
As a member of the stage crew our service to God is to make sure that the pastors and presenters of that gospel on any given day are as comfortable as they could possibly be to speak about the gospel.  We make sure that whatever they need, whether is water or a towel, is at their disposal.  It is through that same gospel the we will reach new lives and new people will be able to hear Gods word.  Although to us it might seen mundane to just move a prop or a table, when we do it for God, it is fragrance to him that we honor him in this matter.  Roman 15:17 (NLT) says "So I have a reason to be enthusiastic about all Christ Jesus has done through me in my service to God".  So what we do is not in vain, The more we serve God and his kingdom the more he actually serves and blesses us in many different areas, this is why we do what we do.
