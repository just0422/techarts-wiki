# Team Vision
Tech arts is a place where God uses, grows and stretches AV technicians.  while creating the environment for others to experience him in the same way."
# Team Overview
The Technical Arts Ministry serves in creating a dynamic environment for authentic worship and effective communication while developing genuine community among its team members.

We are a team of highly motivated, committed, servant leaders who value excellence and one another.  We strive to create an environment that is inviting, and we pray that God uses our efforts to help create a “wow factor” that will lead many to Christ and life change.

The ministry consists of five groups:  Audio, lighting, video, stage management, and technical producers.  Together, we are committed to working behind the scenes to ensure that the message is being communicated creatively and distraction free.
# Team Role

# Team Agreement
## Attire 
All team members are asked to wear black when serving.  Our desire is to display professionalism.

## Promptness
Being on time is key for maximum preparedness to serve.  If you are going to be late, notification should be made to your team leader.

## Communication
The team communicates via an app called “Slack”.  Each member should create an account so that they can stay abreast of all ministry concerns.

## Scheduling
Administrators will do their best to consider personal needs when making the schedule.  Scheduling is done via Planning Center On-line (PCO), an app which is available on your phone.  Each member should create an account and keep phone numbers and e-mail addresses current.  

## Commitment
Ministry members are asked to serve one Sunday per month.  Sundays will consist of all three services at the Glendale campus.  On Sunday, team members are expected to arrive at 7:00 for set up and be prepared to atatend the Dream Team Huddle at 7:45, at which time the service flow for the day is reviewed with all involved for the days services.   Additionally, the Thursday prior to the Sunday that you are scheduled to serve there will be a rehearsal starting at 7pm.
