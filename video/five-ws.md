# Who does what we do?
On a weekly basis, there is team of three or more camera operators, plus a video director and switch board operator
# What do we do?
We use the camera and broadcast technologies to share our worship with both people in our church and online
# Where do we do what we do?
Our camera operators serve in the sanctuary and the video director and switch board operator serve in the control room.  The two groups communicate with each other over a closed communications system.
_As of right now, we only have a camera team at CTG_
# When do we do what we do?
Currently, we serve once a month, but you are able to participate more as your availability allows.  There are always special events and services going on with plenty of opportunities to serve.
# Why do we do what we do?
We strive to both assist in the creation of and to capture the atmosphere of worship in the sanctuary while presenting that same experience to our online family.  We do this by using a variety of shots and transitions which help to share the worship experience with everyone we encounter.
