# Tripod
By design, the tripod is mean to remove the worry of tired arms and shaky hands. Our tripods are a little more advanaced. While they definitely keep the camera level and steady, they also provide other functionalities. There is a handle that protrudes from the top of the tripod. It is located just below the camera, but above the legs:

We use this handle for 2 primary functions: pan / tilt and zoom.
## Pan / Tilt
Panning and tilting the camera are every-service actions for our team. We use the handle indicated above to perform these actions. The most important thing, however, is that our camera's movement is _smooth_ whenever it is live on screen. Let's take a look at the following video and see an example of a smooth pan vs a rough pan:

It's pretty easy to see which shot looked better. How could this have happened though? There is one possibility. Maybe the tripod was too tight? Maybe it was too loose? We have the capability of modifiying how much effort we need to put in to pan and tilt. The best part is that it **doesn't** have any effect on the level-ness of the camera!. On the physical tripod, there are 2 knobs. One controls pan and the other controls tilt. When we twist one direction, it becomes easier to move the camera. When we twist another, it becomes harder:

There is no standard tightness that we need to adhere to. As long as the camera moves smoothly, we can set it at what we like!
