# Key Terms
# Rule of Thirds
Let's take a look at an image of Pastor Chris:
**INSERT PCD ON STAGE**
Now, let's split this image into 3 sections (twice):
**INSERT VETICAL THIRDS PCD**
**INSERT HORIZONTAL THIRDS PCD**
These lines actually help us frame our images. Let's start by examining the vertical ones. Whenever our subject is facing towards the camera, we keep them directly in between both vertical ones. When our subject is facing a different angle, we off-center them in the image. The larger the angle, the further we move from center. It's easier to illustrate this, so let's compare some images:
**INSERT 2 IMAGES (CENTERED AND LEFT THIRD) FORM CAM 1**
**INSERT 2 IMAGES (CENTERED AND RIGHT THIRD) FORM CAM 3**
**INSERT 2 IMAGES (CENTERED AND RIGHT THIRD) FORM CAM 4**
In all the examples we offset Pastor Chris in the image so that it looks more natural.
