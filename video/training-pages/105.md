The color of light plays a huge role in how a camera looks. As humans, our brains do a lot of work to create a clean high quality image from the light that we take in. The cameras, however, simply cannot match the ability of the human brain. This explains why a picture taken indoors may seem warm or "orange-y", while a picture taken in the middle of the day may seem cooler or "blue-ish." 
**INSERT ORANGE AND BLUE IMAGES**
Our cameras have the ability to adjust for the color of the light coming into the camera.
