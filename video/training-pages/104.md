# Key Terms
| Term | Defintion |

| Iris | Controls how much light gets into the camera |
| Washed out | An image that gets overloaded with too much light, causing white to bleed everywhere and changing bright colors to white |
| Gain | Artificial image brightness adjustment |

# Iris
As we mentioned in the last article, cameras operate by letting light in and turning it into images through lenses and internal computers. As humans, when there's too much light, we usually close our eyes or squint to limit the light entering our eyes. Cameras do not have that luxury. Instead, they will take in all the light and try and interpret it. Usually that will leave us with a washed out image:
**INSERT WASHED OUT IMAGE**

On the flip side, when there is too little light, our camera will attempt to gather whatever light it can and formulate an image. That image though, will usually be very dark and unclear. In fact, the camera may even have a hard time focusing (if in autofocus mode).
**INSERT DARK IMAGE**

In order to solve this, camera makers stole another idea from the human eye. As humans we have what's called an iris. The job of the iris is to control how much light gets into the eye. When we enter a dark room, our irises open to attempt to take in any light possible. When we go outside during the day, our irises will close because it is much brighter than indoors. Our cameras have an iris that works the exact same way. 

**INSERT IRIS RING**
If we venture to the front of the camera, we mentioned that there are 3 rings. When know the first two (focus and zoom). The last remaining ring belongs to iris. When we open up the iris of the camera (rotate counter clockwise), the camera will take in more light and the image will be brighter. When we close the iris, less light enters the camera and the image gets darker. It is our job to make sure that the image looks as real as possible. This means that at different angles and distances the iris will be different. On the camera, there is a measurement denoting the current iris. It is on the lower left corner of the screen deonted by **F##**. When the number increases, the iris will close. When the number decrease, the iris will open.

*Note: Our cameras do have an auto iris function. We don't use it though. Since our room is dark in some areas, the camera will be constantly trying to adjust iris. That will affect how the image looks at any given momen*
