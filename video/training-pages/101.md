# Sony NX5
In order to capture video we use High Definition camcorders. The camera we use is called a Sony HXR-NX5U NXCAM. All of our cameras are the same model:

We currently use 3 of these cameras on a weekly basis. There's a fourth, but it only comes out if we need it.

# Some logistics
Before we get into the nitty gritty of _how_ we use the cameras, let's get some basics out of the way. 

Our video director decides what shot goes on screen. In doing so, they communicate to each of us on camera so that we can get the shots we need. Although we all know each other, our communication is standardize, therefore, we don't use names to talk during the service. Each camera is given a number (based off of the input on the switcher, but that's a much later lesson ;)). Take a look at the digram below to see where our cameras are located and what number is assigned:

Camera's 1, 2, and 3 are stationary cameras. They are mounted on tripods and are connected to the wall outlet for power. Camera 4 usually has no tripod. The person who works with this camera is able to freely roam around the sanctuary to get different shots. For this reason, we call that camera the roamer. Now, despite the ability to roam, the camera is not wireless. However, these wires are very long. It would be very difficult to both operate the camera and maintain the wires. For that reason, we usually have a team member assisting the roamer with their wires.
