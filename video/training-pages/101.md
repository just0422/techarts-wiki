# Key Terms

# Sony NX5
In order to capture video we use High Definition camcorders. The camera we use is called a Sony HXR-NX5U NXCAM. All of our cameras are the same model:

We currently use 3 of these cameras on a weekly basis. There's a fourth, but it only comes out if we need it.

# Some logistics
Before we get into the nitty gritty of _how_ we use the cameras, let's get some basics out of the way. Our video director decides what shot goes on screen. In doing so, they communicate to each of us on camera so that we can get the shots we need. This communication is standardized. Although we all know each other, we don't use names to talk during the service. Each camera is given a number (based off of the input on the switcher, but that's a much later lesson ;))
