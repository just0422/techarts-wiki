<!-- TITLE: Five Ws of Producers -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Five Ws -->

# Who does what we do?
Each week, we have one Technical Producer running our three services. 
# What do we do?
The Technical Producer is responsible for calling all technical cues for each service, as well as works with our stage managers to solidify any stage movements to maintain the structure in our service flow. 
# Where do we do what we do?
We have Technical Producers at both our Glendale and Bushwick Campuses. They're positioned in our technical booths allowing them to get a wholistic view of our sanctuary. 
# When do we do what we do?
We currently have a once a month rotation, where the TP's serve for all three of our glendale services. Our current call time 7am on sunday mornings, and we stay through till the end of our last service. We do require the TP to attend a thursday night service run through, along with our worship and tech team, the week that they are on to help them be as prepared as possible. 

At our CTB campus, the schedule is the same as our Glendale schedule but you're only responsible for our one, 6pm service. Call time is 4pm.
