# Who does what we do?
On a weekly basis, there are at least 4 members of the audio team present. One engineer operates the console that controls what the people in the sanctuary, overflow spaces, and watching our online stream of the service hears. Our other engineer operates the console that controls what the people on stage (singers, musicians, pastors, hosts) hear. The other 2 team members are assistants to our engineers.
_At CTB, we use a physical and virtual console. Our vitural console is operated through an iPad_
# What do we do?
On the audio team, we mix, enhance, amplify, and distribute what happens on the stage, and make it sonically presentable to the congregation in the room and those in our online audience. We also help those on the stage convey their message (both musical and non-musical) freely and without distraction.
# Where do we do what we do?
At CTG, we have two tech booth's (one for each console). One is located in the balcony of the sanctuary, while the other is on the right side of the room.
At CTB, we have one tech booth for our only console. Our second engineer operates the iPad from behind the black curtain next to the stage.
# When do we do what we do?
At CTG, our current rotation is one Sunday per month. There are currently some slots open on Wednesday nights to serve during our prayer meetings.
At CTBE, our current rotation is ____
At CTBPM, our current rotation is two Sundays a month for our 6 pm service.
# Why do we do what we do?
We do what we do so that our audience can experience the audio elements of the service in a way that enhances their sonic experience, and ultimately and most importantly, allows them to experience what God wants them to receive in a service. We want to use the tools that we have (audio consoles, microphones, speakers, etc) to present a professional, high quality, distraction-free sonic experience.
