# Who does what we do?
On a weekly basis, there are at least 4 members of the audio team present. One engineer operates the console that controls what the people in the sanctuary, overflow spaces, and watching our online stream of the service hears. Our other engineer operates the console that controls what the people on stage (singers, musicians, pastors, hosts) hear. The other 2 team members are assistants to our engineers.
_At CTB, our second console is viturally operated through an iPad_
# What do we do?
On the audio team, we mix, enhance, amplify, and distribute what happens on the stage, and make it sonically presentable to the congregation in the room and those in our online audience. We also help those on the stage convey their message (both musical and non-musical) freely and without distraction.
# Where do we do what we do?
In both of our sanctuaries, we have a tech booth where our lighting board operators do their thing

CTG: We have the Front of House console in the tech booth in the balcony of the sanctuary. The Monitor console is located in a different tech booth, located on the main floor of the sanctuary, on the audienceâ€™s right side of the room.

CTB: The Front of House console is located within the tech booth, which is located against the back wall of the sanctuary. The monitor engineer and their A2 are stationed on the side of the stage behind the black curtain.
# When do we do what we do?
Currently, there's a rotation of 3 ops at CTG.
At the moment, there are trainees at CTB vying to claim the top spot as CTB LBO. You could be #1!

CTG: Our current rotation is one Sunday per month. There are currently some slots open on Wednesday nights to serve during our prayer meetings.

CTB: Our current rotation is two Sundays a month for our 6 pm service.
# Why do we do what we do?
We do what we do so that our audience can experience the audio elements of the service in a way that enhances their sonic experience, and ultimately and most importantly, allows them to experience what God wants them to receive in a service. We want to use the tools that we have (audio consoles, microphones, speakers, etc) to present a professional, high quality, distraction-free sonic experience.
