<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Training -->

If you've reach here, you _must_ be interested in audio! That's great! We're glad to have you. Before we get started, we'd like to make sure you know what you're in for. On our audio team we strive for excellence. In doing so, we use complicated equipment to make specific adjustments to the sound that permeates the room.

What does that mean for you? Well, the best answer is that it's different for every person. Some people fit best as assistants to our audio engineers. Others thrive in listening to the mix and giving feedback. And yet others work best engineering the audio. With that said, it means that you won't start off using our consoles on day 1. We need to make sure that you have a strong foundation and understand of the intricacies of sound before that happens. However, if your end goal is getting behind that console, we'll get you there! It'll just take some time. 

On that note, let's get started:
