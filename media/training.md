Before you get started, there's a quick note. We like to make sure that everyone has ample preparation before you take the reigns for yourself. For that reason, we implement a bunch of _shadowing_ rounded out by some real service practice (with a buddy of course)
# The basics
With that said, you should contact Veronica and she'll help arrange a server where you can _shadow_ our Media technicians in the control room.
