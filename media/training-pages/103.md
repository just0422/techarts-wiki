# Stage Display
There is a secondary output from ProPresenter that is not visible to all members of the congregation. It is used to assist the singers with lyrics and speakers with verses. It also provides the ability to display the current time of day and time left in a segment of the service. We can even send messages to those on stage if we need to!
**INSERT IMAGE OF STAGE DISPLAY**

There is a way to see what is currently on the stage display. When you hover over the preview screen in ProPresenter, the _Toggle Preview/Stage DIsplay_ button will swap the main screen and stage display.
