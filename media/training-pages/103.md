# Key Terms
| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Clock | A countdown clock visible to those on stage that indicates how much time is left in the segment / video |
# Stage Display
There is a secondary output from ProPresenter that is not visible to all members of the congregation. It is used to assist the singers with lyrics and speakers with scriptures and sermon notes. It also provides the ability to display the current time of day and time left in a segment of the service. We can even send messages to those on stage if we need to!

There is a way to see what is currently on the stage display. Let's hover over the preview screen in ProPresenter. The _Toggle Preview/Stage DIsplay_ button will appear and allow us to swap the main screen and stage display.

We use multiple stage display layouts in ProPresenter. They are tailored for different parts of the service. Let's go through our 4 standard layouts and see what content they offer:
## Worship
![Worship Stage Display](/uploads/media-screenshots/103-worship-stage-display.jpg "Worship Stage Display")

We use this stage display for worship segments. There is white clock dedicated to counting down the time left and a yellow clock that simply tells time. There are two slide outputs as well. One shows the current slide (This is what everyone sees on screen). The bottom section shows the next slide. This is helpful for the situation where a singer may lose track of where they are in the song or forget a lyric. Whenever we have music, we have this display.

## Host
![Host Stage Display](/uploads/media-screenshots/103-host-stage-display.jpg "Host Stage Display")

We use this stage display for the segment of service dedicated to annoucements. Graphics that appear on screen are also displayed in the big middle section of this screen. At the top we have a yellow clock that tells time, a white clock that indicates the time left in annoucments and a green clock that shows the time left in a video. At the bottom of the screen is our message view. Sometimes we need to get a quick message to the host (Maybe an annoucment has changed or we can't hear them well). In this scenario we can type the message, hit send and it displays for the host to see (see below).
## Sermon
![Semon Stage Display](/uploads/media-screenshots/103-semon-stage-display.jpg "Semon Stage Display")

We use this stage display for the sermon. We minimize how much information we display for our speakers to see. We won't send them messages because it may be distracting. For those reasons we only have the current slide appear with a yellow clock for the current time and white clock with time left.
## Video
![Video Stage Display](/uploads/media-screenshots/103-video-stage-display.jpg "Video Stage Display")

We use this stage display during videos like the countdown. It shows two big bold clocks (a yellow one that displays time and a white one that shows video countdown) that are difficult to miss. It ensures that everyone who needs to see them sees them.
# Clocks
In ProPresenter, we can utilize clocks to help make sure that our service remains on time.
*Now this isn't a guarantee of timeliness, but it gives a sense of comfort that everyone is aware of these close*

How do we access them though? Well at the top of the ProPresenter screen there's a button called _Clock_." When we click it this appears:

![103 Clocks](/uploads/media-screenshots/103-clocks.jpg "103 Clocks")

We use multiple clocks here at CT. It allows us to setup all of our service countdowns once and just trigger them during service. However, they usually aren't on the stage display at the same time. Each stage display has its own clock in the upper corner. Their labels match the labels of the clocks we have here. So when the worship stage display is active, the worship clock is visible and the countdown can be started.

There are multiple types of clocks in ProPresenter, as shown below:
| Clock | Function |
| --- | --- |
| ![Count Down Timer](/uploads/media-screenshots/103-count-down-timer.jpg "Count Down Timer") | Counts down to 0 |
| ![Count Down Time](/uploads/media-screenshots/103-count-down-time.jpg "Count Down Time") | Counts down to a specific time of day |
| ![Elapsed Time](/uploads/media-screenshots/103-elapsed-time.jpg "Elapsed Time") | Counts up forever (if a limit is not set) |

We mostly use the countdown clock, as it is most effective for us in service. In order to set the time, we can click on the time and begin typing. To start the clock we can simply click the start button next to the clock.

# Stage Messages
Stage messages are used much less frequently than clocks. However, they are still important to know. At the bottom of the host stage display, we can see a rectangle dedicated to messages:
**INSERT BOTTOM OF HOST STAGE DISPLAY**

At the top of the screen there's a button called _Stage Messages_ (not to be confused with _Messages_). When we click that button, this appears:
**INSERT STAGE MESSAGES BUTTON**

We can then type our message and click send. Once we do that, this will happen:

At this point we know the basics of using ProPresenter, but there are some things we need to learn away from the computer that will be very helpful.
