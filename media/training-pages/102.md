# Key Terms
| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Background | The image, video, and jumpbacks that gets put on screen
| Clear | Removing _someting_ from the screen |
| Document | ProPresenter file that contains all of the slides we'll put on screen |
| Slide | Similar to PowerPoint, this will appear on screen when activated |

# Slides and Backgrounds
## Put it up!
In our 101 doc, we saw an empty ProPresenter application. In reality, we will probably never face this. There will be already be a bunch of documents in the left pane that are usable for us. Take a look below. This is what it will probably look like:
**INSERT PROPRESENTER LEFT PANE**
We have a large number of documents so the search bar is available to quickly search through them.
*Note: For the purposes of this document, we're going to use a stripped down version of ProPresenter. Later on we'll add documents in, but for now there will only be a few present*

When we activate a document, the right side of the screen will populate with slides that belong to it:
**INSERT PROPRESENTER RIGHT PANE**

In order to place a slide on screen, we can simply click on the slide. An orange border will be placed on the slide, and we will see it appear on our small preview screen on the top left of the screen
**INSERT PROPRESENTER SELECT SLIDE GIF**

When we click on another slide, it simply replaces the slide before it:
**INSERT PROPRESENTER SELECT NEXT SLIDE**

There is a caveat though! Here we need to distinguish a slide and a background (and how they affect each other). Let's imagine the propresenter output screen. There are, in fact, 2 layers of output that we can output two the screens. The bottom (or _background_) layer is used for images, videos and jumpbacks. The top (or _foreground_) layer is used for slides. Slides and backgrounds can be placed on screen at the same time. However, only one of each can exist simultaneously. When a slide is up and we click a new slide, that new one replaces the old. The same behavior exists for backgrounds:
**INSERT PROPRESENTER SLIDE + BACKGROUND**
**INSERT SELECT NEXT SLIDE GIF w/ BACKGROUND**
**INSERT SELECT NEXT BACKGROUND GIF w/ SLIDE**

## Take it down!
Now that we know how to add slides, how do we take them down? Well there are multiple ways to clear a slide. We can insert a blank side and simply click it:
**INSERT BLANK SLIDE CLICK GIF**

However, there's a more universal, intuitive way to clear a slide. At the top left corner of the screen, we can see 3 buttons labeled *Clear All*, *Slides*, *BKGs*:
![Clear Buttons](/uploads/media-screenshots/102-clear-buttons.jpg "Clear Buttons")

Each of these serve a purpose. They are pretty self explanatory:
| Button | Function |
| --- | --- |
| ![Clear All](/uploads/media-screenshots/102-clear-all.jpg "Clear All") | Clears both the background and slide |
| ![Clear Slides](/uploads/media-screenshots/102-clear-slides.jpg "Clear Slides") | Clears the slide only |
| ![Clear Backgrounds](/uploads/media-screenshots/102-clear-bkgs.jpg "Clear Backgrounds") | Clears the background only |

At this point, we can put anything on screen and take it off at our leisure. There's another half of the story. That's our stage display. Read on to learn!
