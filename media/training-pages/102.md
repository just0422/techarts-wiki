# Slides and Backgrounds
In our 101 doc, we saw an empty ProPresenter application. In reality, we will probably never face this. There will be already be a bunch of documents in the left pane that are usable for us. Take a look below. This is what it will probably look like:
**INSERT PROPRESENTER LEFT PANE**
We have a large number of documents so the search bar is available to quickly search through them.
*Note: For the purposes of this document, we're going to use a stripped down version of ProPresenter. Later on we'll add documents in, but for now there will only be a few present*

When we activate a document, the right side of the screen will populate with slides that belong to it:
**INSERT PROPRESENTER RIGHT PANE**
