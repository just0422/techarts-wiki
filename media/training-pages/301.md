# Thursday night
On thursday nights, our entire team gathers with the music ministry and we run through our Sunday service. It gives us a chance to work out any bugs that may appear. All the technicians who are scheduled to serve on Sunday are required to be present on the preceding Thursday.
## Pro Presenter and Planning Center
Before we arrive on a Thursday, we should check planning center. We examine the flow and listened to each song at least once. Upon arrival on Thursday, we:
1. Open up ProPresenter and create a playlist for the coming Sunday:
**INSERT EMPTY PLAYLIST**
2. Use planning center to verify that each song is present:
**INSERT SONGS IN PLAYLIST**
3. Create arrangements for each song and name them using this format: MM / DD - SONG
**INSERT ARRANGEMENT NAME SAVE**
4. Add our timer and stage display cues to the first song:
**INSERT FIRST SONG CUES**

At this point we are ready to confer with the technical producer. Together we:

5. Go through each song and select an appropriate jumpback and color scheme
