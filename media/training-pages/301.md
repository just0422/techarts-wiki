# Thursday night
On thursday nights, our entire team gathers with the music ministry and we run through our Sunday service. It gives us a chance to work out any bugs that may appear. All the technicians who are scheduled to serve on Sunday are required to be present on the preceding Thursday.
## Pro Presenter and Planning Center
Before we arrive on a Thursday, we should check planning center. We examine the flow and listened to each song at least once. Upon arrival on Thursday, we:
1. open up ProPresenter and create a playlist for the coming Sunday:
**INSERT EMPTY PLAYLIST**
1. We use planning center to verify that each song is present:
**INSERT SONGS IN PLAYLIST**
We create arrangements for each song and name them using this format: MM / DD - SONG
**INSERT ARRANGEMENT NAME SAVE**
Next we add our timer and stage display cues to the first song:
**INSERT FIRST SONG CUES**
