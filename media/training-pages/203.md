# Grouping
Remember back to our [104 - Media Theory](/media/training-pages/104) article. We learned about the different parts of a song. We can apply that knowledge to grouping! Let's take a look at one of our songs:
**INSERT OH SING**

Where does the verse end? Where does the chorus start? When is the bridge? All of these are valid questions. Let's take a look at the slides after we group them:
**INSERT OH SING WITH GROUPS**

It's much easier to distinguish these parts of the song now! In order to add these groups, we can right click and find the groups sub-menu. Available are all the groups we can use for any song. Once we choose one, it will make every slide after that fall into the same group. In order to change groups for the next part of the song, we simply find the first slide of that part, and change its group!
**INSERT GIF ADDING 2 GROUPS TO OH SING**

Once the groups for our entire song are setup, we can take a look at arrangements. These take groups to the next level.
