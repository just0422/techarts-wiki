# What are Cues?
We've learned about how to use different clocks, create and use different stage displays, and add new media to a slide. These tools are all versatile and have become a necessity in our services. However, trying to manage these tools _and_ make sure the slides are well-timed and accurate can prove to be a difficult feat. Luckily, we have access to **cues**. When we setup cues, we create _triggers_ that can do the following:  
* Clear backgrounds, live, audio or all
* Display media (yes, all media that's put onto a slide is _actually_ just a cue)
* Restart, stop, or start a clock
* Change stage displays
* Activate multi screen layouts *(Future feature)*

## Media
## Clocks
In order to add a clock cue, we simply right click on the slide we'd like to edit select add cue > clocks > _the clock we want_ **(VERIFY THIS MENU STRUCTURE)**
**INSERT IMAGE OF MENU STRUCTURE**

Once we do that, this symbol will appear on the slide:
**INSERT IMAGE SLIDE WITH CLOCK CUE**

By default the clock cue is set to _start_ the timer. We can change that by simply right clicking selecing edit cue > _the clock we want_ **(VERIFY THIS MENU STRUCTURE)**
**INSERT IMAGE EDIT MENU STRUCTURE**

The following menu will appear and allow us to modify the function of our clock:
**INSERT IMAGE OF EDIT CLOCK CUE MENU**

Let's see it all in action

## Stage Displays
In order to add a stage display cue, we simply right click on the slide we'd like to edit select add cue > stage display > _the clock we want_ **(VERIFY THIS MENU STRUCTURE)**
**INSERT IMAGE OF MENU STRUCTURE**

Once we do that, this symbol will appear on the slide:
**INSERT IMAGE SLIDE WITH STAGE DISPLAY CUE**

## Multi-screen layouts
*Future feature, future explanation* ;)
