# What are Cues?
We've learned about how to use different clocks, create and use different stage displays, and add new media to a slide. These tools are all versatile and have become a necessity in our services. However, trying to manage these tools _and_ make sure the slides are well-timed and accurate can prove to be a difficult feat. Luckily, we have access to **cues**. When we setup cues, we create _triggers_ that can do the following:  
* Restart, stop, or start a clock
* Clear backgrounds, live, audio or all
* Change stage displays
* Display media (yes, all media that's put onto a slide is _actually_ just a cue)
* Activate multi screen layouts *(Future feature)*
