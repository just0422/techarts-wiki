# Key Terms
# Slides
Slides are the fundamental foundation of ProPresenter. Without them, we really wouldn't have a use for this software. With that in mind, let's learn how to manage slides. To start off, creating a slide is really simple. Just like documents, playlists and media, all we have to do is hit the **+** in the bottom left area of the slide area. A blank slide will appear for us to manipulate. Let's right click the slide and take a look at the options available
**INSERT SLIDE RIGHT CLICK MENU**

## Edit Slide
First let's click on Edit Slide. This is the screen that pops up.
**INSERT EDIT SLIDE SCREEN**

It's the most powerful editing screen in ProPresenter. We can do virtually anything to our slides. We usually spend some time in here when we have a new song or sermon. At the bottom left of the editing area, there is a little **+** button. This can be used to easily add a new slide into the presentation. There is also a **show slide** button in the same area. It allows us to put the slide up on screen without leaving the editor.
On the right hand side of the screen, there's a column with 6 different tabs. This is where the customizability of a slide really lies. For most purposes, we mainly use the 5 tab, which is the text formatting tab:
**INSERT TEXT FORMATTING TAB**

We can change font, color, and alignment if ncessary. Even though we don't really use the other tabs regularly, let's quickly define how they work.
| Tab | Function |
| --- | --- |
| | Here we can change resolution, background color and presentation category (song, sermon, etc...) | 
| | These are slide properties that are specific only to this slide. |
| | The build properties let us adjust transitions for this slide specifically |
| | Object properties are useful for when we put anything other than text on a slide |
| | The image/videos property tab lets us ensure that media files look nice in our presentation. Usually when they're sent to us, they look nice already, but this is here just in case |

## Quick Edit
Sometimes we catch a typo/mistake during service. There may not be enough time to open the full editor, make the change, and close before the next slide is put up. In that case, we need a quick option to edit the slide and continue along. Luckily, ProPresenter provides us with the quick edit option. In the image above it's visible directly below the edit slide button in the right click menu. When we click on it, our slide will swell and become editable:
**INSERT QUICK EDIT SCREEN**

We are now able to type our fix and still change slides (if need be). Once we're done, we can click the **x** and continue along. Let's take a look at this in practice:

## Reflow Editor
The last type of editor ProPresenter offers is the Reflow Editor. It is not as powerful as the full editor view, but what it lacks in power it surely makes up in convience. Whenever we insert a new song/scripture into ProPresenter, we almost never type it in word by word. We use the computer's copy-paste function. The issue that arises here is that ProPresenter doesn't make the distinction of slides for us. Therefore, the entire blob of copied text we paste will go right into one slide:
**INSERT ALL TEXT IN ONE SLIDE**

In order to separate text, we have to do a lot of scrolling and navigating to get to the part we want to push to the next slide and then repeat again for the next one. This can be tedious and a slight waste of time. Let's call up the reflow editor and see how to do it there instead. If we hit **CONTROL + R** *(INSERT MAC KEYS)*, let's see what pops up:
**INSERT REFLOW EDITOR**

We now have a view that let's us see all the text on all the slides in one section. We can make edits to these slides and even do some formatting if we need to. Let's take a look at how to create a song using the reflow editor:
