# Key Terms
| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| House | The area of the room where the congregation sits |
| Stage | The area of the room where singers, musicians and pastors serve |
| Jumpbacks | Motion graphics that are mostly used as backgrounds for songs |
| Lyrics | Words of a song |
| PSA | Stands for _public service announcement_. Each of these slides are dedicated to giving members specific information |
| Verses | Scripture from the bible |
| Confidence Monitor | Television that's only visible from the stage that displays countdown clocks, verses, and lyrics | 
| Video Wall | Large LED screens on stage |
_Note: Some of these might be obvious, but let's not assume. We'll use these terms nearly every time we serve_
# How it all works
Before we take a look at the software we use and the buttons we press, let's learn about how it's all setup. In the control room, we have 2 iMac desktops. One of them is used for primarily for lyrics and PSAs. We call it the **Lyrics Comptuer**. The other is primarily used for jumpbacks, PSAs and verses. We refer to it as the **Media Computer**. 

Each computer sends its main output to our video team. The video team then has the option of displaying it to our online audience, using their 11th and 12th buttons. Therefore, they usually refer to these two computers as 11 (Media) and 12 (Lyrics). However, it does not stop there. The two computer outputs also continue past the video team to the video walls in the sanctuary. The media computer feeds the middle video wall, while the lyrics computer feeds the two side video walls.

There is one last output that the lyrics computer sends out. In addition to the main screen, this computer outputs to the confidence monitor.
# The tool we use
For our media team, both computers use software called ProPresenter. We can use it to display lyrics / verses, show images, play audio / video at any point it time. We can also use it to display the current time, countdown clocks, lyrics and verses to those who are on stage. Here's what it looks like:

Don't worry if none of it makes sense, we'll start to peel it apart and learn about this tool next
