# Configuring our Stage Display
Back in our [103 - Stage Display](/media/training-pages/103#stage-display) tutorial, we first introduced the stage display. In fact this was the image we used to first examine it:

That little menu on the right is the bread and butter of everything we look to learn right now. We may have ignored it's existence originally, but no more! So how do we get there? Well first let's click on **Configure Stage Display** _NOTE: I don't know where this button is, look it up (just know that it exists lol)_. The picture above is what should appear. So let's start inspecting:

***ALL PARTS ARE SCREENSHOTS***
| Part | Function |
| --- | --- |
| Top scroll | These are all the stage displays we have. Any new stage display created will show up here. When we click on one of these, it becomes the active stage display on the confidence monitor |
| Current / Next slides | This area allows us to enable/disable our current and next slides and chord charts. We can also adjust the font size, color, and text alignment of the words for the current and next slide sections. Adjusting these _does not_ have any effect on the actual slides in the presentation |
| Clocks | We also spoke about clocks in [103 - Stage Display](/media/training-pages/103#clocks). Here we are able to choose what clock is available on our stage display. We can change their colors and set them to change to a _bad_ color if they go over their time |
| Messages | This is where we determine what the host will see if we sent them a message. We can also make the message flash subtly to really get their attention |
| PCO Integration | We don't really use this part, but it's an integration with a feature on Planning Center |

When we enable any of these pieces, they show up in the stage display in a default spot/size. We can drag them around and resize them to fit any of our needs:

After all of this, we're almost ready. Our next section will tie everything together and keep us operating seemlessly
